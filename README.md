# World_Weather_Analysis
analysis with API's, python, and jupyter notebooks

## Overview
The beginnings of a "plan my trip" app to help fictional coworker, Jack. The code generates 2000 random latitude and longitudes, uses the citipy module to find the closest city to those coordinates, and filters through those cities to find ones with hotels nearby. In the end, we created a map of several hundred cities based on user temperature preference (in this case 70 - 85 degrees farenheit for testing). From these choices, we picked Mexico as a destination, and made a travel itineray for four relatively close cities in central Mexico. Maps were made for these as well.
